# MyFirstNeuralNetwork
This is my first neural network, and it is a very simple one. You have inputs and outputs and the model is trained with this data. You can adjust it to any kind of data you want, but for default is for a Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion.

## Requisites
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)

## Instructions
1. Create your environment to running:
    ````
    conda create --prefix ./env python=3.8
    ````
2. Activate your environment:
    ````
    conda activate ./env
    ````
3. Install the libraries:
    ````
    conda install --file=requirements.txt

4. Now you can play with it:
